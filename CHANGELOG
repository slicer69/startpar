startpar 0.64
===============

* Added sys/sysmacros.h header on non-FreeBSD systems to
  make it possible to use makedev().

* Fixed typos in manual page. Patches provided by Dmitry Bogatov.

* Make sure we do not try to use unallocated memory when detecting consoles.

* Fixed handing of overriding location of init.d on the command line.

* Fixed testsuite script to give better results to tests. Numbered
  tests so mixed "success" and "failure" messages would be more clear.

* Updated testsuite to work with insserv 1.20.0.  

startpar 0.63
===============

* Used constants for some strings instead of checking sizeof().

* Made makefile parsing more fault talerant so the parsing function
  returns an error instead of immediately calling exit().

* Updated manual page with new Makefile-style flag and location 
  information.

* Switched manual page location for startpar from
  section 8 (admin tools) to 1 (general system tools)
  since it can be used by anyone.

* Move startpar install location from /sbin to /bin since it can
be used by regular users for some tasks. 


startpar 0.62
===============

* Fixed typos in startpar.c error messages.
  Moves Debian patch 99 upstream.
* Applied Debian patches 81_timeout and 83_hardening upstream.
* Minor code clean-up in makeboot.c to remove duplicate
  instructions.
* Added changelog to the tarball.


startpar 0.61
===============

* Applied signal patch from Petter Heinholdtsen which should avoid
  masking SIGINT to services.
  Addresses Debian bug #679630
* Applied patch from Francis Russell which should greatly speed up
  make-style dependency checking in startpar (Fracis's test
  suggest patch causes just 0.25% number of loop/dependency checks
  compared to original.)
  This should close Debian bugs which report startpar is bailing
  out when checking dependencies.
  Addresses Debian bugs #609959 and #696359.
* Documented -f flag.
  Should address Debian bug #763703.
* Documented -e flag.
* Made minor source adjustments so that startpar will compile and
  run on FreeBSD.


startpar 0.60
================
* Updated manual page with new copyright.
* Updated Makefile to work with GCC or Clang.
* Updated Makefile to no longer use SVN, we use git now.
* Fixed package building and signing in Makefile.
* Added short description of startpar to README file.
* Cleaned up unused temp/defines in Makefile.
