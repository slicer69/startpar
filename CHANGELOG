startpar 0.61
===============

* Applied signal patch from Petter Heinholdtsen which should avoid
  masking SIGINT to services.
  Addresses Debian bug #679630
* Applied patch from Francis Russell which should greatly speed up
  make-style dependency checking in startpar (Fracis's test
  suggest patch causes just 0.25% number of loop/dependency checks
  compared to original.)
  This should close Debian bugs which report startpar is bailing
  out when checking dependencies.
  Addresses Debian bugs #609959 and #696359.
* Removed undocumented and unused -e flag.
* Documented -f flag.
  Should address Debian bug #763703.
